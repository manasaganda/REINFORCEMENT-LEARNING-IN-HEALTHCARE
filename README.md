# REINFORCEMENT-LEARNING-IN-HEALTHCARE
Reinforcement Learning (RL) in healthcare involves using AI agents to learn optimal treatment or diagnostic strategies by interacting with clinical environments. Applications include personalized medicine, dynamic treatment planning, and hospital resource management. It aims to improve patient outcomes through data-driven, adaptive decision-making.
Diabetes is a chronic condition that requires continuous monitoring and control of blood glucose (BG) levels. Proper insulin dosing is critical to avoid complications such as hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). Traditional approaches use rule-based or physician-guided insulin schedules, which may not adapt well to individual variability and real-time dynamics.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful framework for learning personalized, adaptive insulin dosing policies by modeling the task as a sequential decision-making problem.
